## Overall financial picture

Beyond these bank statements, my complete financial position includes £20,000 in investments and consistent monthly income approximately three times my average monthly expenses.

## Regarding cryptocurrency investments

The regular MoonPay transactions represent my planned investment strategy in digital assets, which forms part of my diversified portfolio alongside my £20,000 traditional investments. These investments are made within my budgeted discretionary spending and don't impact my ability to meet financial obligations.

## Regarding overdraft usage

My account shows temporary use of my arranged, interest-free £2,000 overdraft facility during December 2024, primarily due to holiday expenses. As the statements demonstrate, I quickly reduced this balance in January and moved substantially into positive territory in February, reflecting my responsible approach to cash flow management.

Thank you for your consideration.
